Once you have followed the setup-for-ansible.txt instructions
you can run the create and teardown scripts for the cluster.

# Run this script when your VMs are up and running at the
#  IP addresses specified in the invenstory/my-cluster/hosts file

  bin/create_k3s.sh

# run this script when you want to tear down the k3s cluster
#  This will uninstall k3s and reboot the VMs

  bin/teardown_k3s.sh
